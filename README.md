## Vulkan Engine (Work-in-Progress)
### Foreword
This repository serves as the foundation of every future project that I intend to undertake; that being said, the code is neither fully optimized, organized, nor prepared for dedicated game development. My current design principle for the engine is "ease-of-use," so I can freely implement new features without reworking the rendering pipeline.

With that being said, many of the aforementioned features you will find in this repository are also works-in-progress. Much like the engine, the features are neither fully optimized, organized, nor prepared for full release.
